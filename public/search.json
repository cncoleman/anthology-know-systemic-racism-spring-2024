By documenting the types and frequency of military-grade equipment such as drones, flashbangs, and armored vehicles through the lens of CS AB481, my research highlights the dissonance between manufacturers’ descriptions and the equipment’s impact on communities. Alongside my mentor Nicole, I introduced a ‘Civilian Description’ category, which includes direct accounts from those affected by police militarization, providing a fuller picture of its consequences. This effort aims to challenge the prevailing narrative, shed light on the emotional and social impacts on BIPOC communities, and foster a more engaged and informed public dialogue on the militarization of our police forces.\n      \n      \n\n      \n  \n  Project Overview\n  \n  Shuvi Jha\n  \n  This quarter, my research within the Know Systemic Racism project aimed to reframe the daily use of military equipment by law enforcement. The trend of police militarization in the United States is rooted in historical developments such as the War on Drugs, which framed drug enforcement as a military conflict, the 1033 Program facilitating the transfer of military equipment to local police, and post-9/11 security measures that further militarized the police. The public witnessed the implications of these practices most visibly during the 2020 protests following George Floyd’s murder, where police used military-grade equipment like armored vehicles, tear gas, and tactical gear.\n  In response, California implemented CS AB481, requiring law enforcement agencies to disclose the militarized equipment they use and secure approval for its deployment. The law categorizes 15 types of equipment, from unmanned vehicles to other items requiring oversight.\n  In my study, I examined the inventories of various Californian law enforcement agencies, including those in Modesto, Redlands, and Chula Vista. I noted the prevalence of equipment such as flashbangs, drones, and rubber bullets. I then aligned these items with CS AB481’s categories and compared the descriptions provided by manufacturers and law enforcement agencies. For instance, the descriptions for the “DJI 200 V2 with Zenmuse XT2 Thermal Camera” drone typically highlight technical efficiencies, like its thermal imaging capabilities and support for various police tasks, yet fail to address the broader implications of its use.\n  To bridge this gap, my mentor Nicole and I introduced a ‘Civilian Description’ category. Drawing from firsthand accounts, this category aims to reflect the actual experiences of community members affected by police militarization. For example, a North Carolina resident recounted frequent drone surveillance at various civic events, underscoring the invasive nature of such monitoring. These accounts prompted us to label the drone as an ‘Omnipresent Surveillance Tool.’\n  \n  \n  \n  Here is a side-by-side comparison of the descriptions provided by law enforcement, manufacturers, and civilians for two types of military equipment.\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  Here, I share some of the real-life use cases that guided my decision to label drone as a “Omnipresent Surveillance Tool” and tear gas as an “Incapacitating Chemical Irritant.”\n  \n  \n  By contrasting official, manufacturer, and civilian descriptions, I confronted established power structures and brought to light the tangible impacts on communities, especially those within BIPOC areas. I documented the emotional labor and trauma faced by civilians, adhering to the principles of data feminism which advocates for rethinking hierarchies. My next goal is to incorporate these civilian experiences and descriptions into Wikidata to democratize the narrative and kickstart a community-wide initiative to challenge the often clinical and detached technical descriptions."
